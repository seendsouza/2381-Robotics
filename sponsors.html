<p>Thanks to Protocase, we were able to print some custom parts to experiment with different designs.</p>

<p>Thank you to Richard Seniuk, the VEX Competition Support Manager in Canada and the owner of ProBots, for lending us some VEX parts and providing us a space to build and test our robot. We would especially like to thank him for helping all teams during competitions when they were having troubles.</p>
