<p>Anthony again, I’m partway through the drive base cad and flywheel towers and I’ve realized that it would be possible for me to gear my entire drivetrain together - this means that I wouldn’t be using chain on drive and I would be able to put in a set of omni wheels in the middle - this would help our parking a lot! With that in mind, I’m also deciding whether or not to gear the drive on pillow bearings - it’ll allow us to have more “working space” above the robot. Our actual mount points will be the same, but because the gears are lower down, they’ll be easier to clear - which is always a bonus. We are also going to run our motors vertical (probably), because that allows us to fit things in between the c-channels, and also use pillow bearings. Our front motor is currently mounted on the front wheel, which makes intake very difficult. If we gear the drive, we would be able to move the motor back just enough so that we could move the intake in - i mean, in theory. Who knows how it works out in practice. Anyways, into inventor we go! And then we’ll see how it goes. - one more thing - using gearing also makes it easier for us to have the wheels in line, which is easier for calculations using our optical shaft encoders for odometry in autonomous. CPT_004 Here’s the first attempt that I have made for this setup. Ideally the bearings would be mounted internal to the c-channels, but it seems like that might pose an issue because they’re going to clip with the wheels. To solve this, we’ll have to move them to outside the c-channel (inside the dip). Our drive bracing will also have to be adjusted to accomodate for this change. This also leaves our rear wheel sticking out a lot more than I would like - we’ll have to fix this as well. We could stick the rear wheels out more, moving them down so that the intake is internal - I think having external intake and external wheels just a bit is a good compromise - this can easily be adjusted later as well. CPT_005 Here we have the drive semi completed. All 8 motors have been added, and as you can see there is a nice long intake path (which means we can mount our flywheel forward). 6 wheels should help us park a lot better, and our intake could also run in between wheels (making parking EVEN EASIER). Things in between wheels won’t hit the parking platfrom because the wheels beside them form a line , and if they’re behind that plane then they are ok.</p>
