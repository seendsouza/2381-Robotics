<p>This meeting everyone was involved, we accomplished a few tasks: * Competition in review * Repair overview * Repairs * Next Competitions timeline * Rebuild Proposal # Competition in review The competition ended up much better than we expected: we seeded 10th overall, and became the 9th alliance captain, picking 99900A during allilance selections. There were, however, some issues with both the robot and the team structure/organization that needed to be reviewed and improved. Starting with the robot: consistency and reliability are better than speed, especially early season. We learned early on that focusing on one thing could get us a lot farther than trying to do multiple things, hence the flyhweel + descore, but we also realized that our robot shouldn’t be built with Keps nuts. Certain parts of the robot experience high forces, particularly the intake area. Our intake area took a lot of force and neeeded to be repaired quite a bit. We didn’t anticipate this, so the best we could do is strengthen it. On the rebuild, we’re definitely going to be looking out for this. The next thing: have backups. The lexan on our hood snapped, and we had to replace it. We only had one backup, so if it had broken again we would have been completely dead in the water. Thankfully, it didn’t. We also should protect that part of our robot a lot more - the lexan can easily be broken through vigorous interaction. # Team Structure and Organization Now, onto team structure and organization. Although our robot was one of the faster scoring robots, we ran into the issue where nobody knew us, and decided not to pick us based on our reputation. It’s incredibly important to have a good reputation, had our schedule been any harder i don’t think many of the good teams would have considered us at all. Even then, when alliance selection came around we realized that we weren’t going to be picked. At that moment, there was a little bit of panic as we weren’t sure who to pick! We hadn’t scouted nearly enough to know who to pick, and the schedule had moved forward, meaning that our team was super confused as to who should be where - we almost missed alliance selection entirely because of that. Next time, we should have someone waiting near the final matches for alliance selection - they should have a pick list and then go up and start reading it off. Our final matches were pretty good, we ended up in quarter finals and lost by 3 points, or a park. A battery fell out of our partner, so we weren’t able to get the park. One reason why bo1 is annoying. # Repair overview There were multiple repairs that needed to occur, most importantly the intake area. In order to accomplish this, we had to dissasemble half of our drive train - something that wasnt super great. We learned however, that next time we should make this much more accessible. Power Expander → pull power from second battery Flywheel changes (autonomous code) * PID to error correct * Minimize ramp up time and maximum accuracy and minimuze overshift Lexan sharttered; so steel hood There was a screw screwing up the flywheel. On tower brace, it was pulling c-channel forward, which caused our flywheel to lose connection to battery Bar under intake (to store two balls) # Competition Timeline Our next competition is going to be on the 8th, of december. In order to get a fair chance of winnig at this competition, we need a lot of driver practice and autonomous testing - that’s all that we’re going to be doing for the next little while. After that, we have a competition on the 15th. It might not be a bad idea for us to have a second robot ready for the competition on the 15th, as it’s going to be two weeks - enough for a good rebuild if we plan everything out and if we’re able to have enough driver practice and autonomous testing in that time. # Rebuild Proposal Anthony here - after the competition on the 8th, I’ve realized that there are a few different ways that we could make our rebuild, one of those involves skids on the bottom of our robot. These should allow us (if our weight distribution allows), to have the rear wheels push the front end of the robot up while the skids on the bottom help us not get caught on the side. We considered using smaller 3.25” wheels, but instead decided that they wouldn’t be faster than 4” wheels on 200rpm. Here’s our idea, we need to be able to outrun v5. In order to do that, we should be running at around 300rpm on 3.25” wheels, or we should be running at 240rpm on 4” wheels. 200rpm on 4” wheels gives a truespeed of around 2500”/s, 240rpm on 4” wheels gives a truespeed of around 3000”/s, and 240rpm on 3.25” wheels gives a truespeed of around 2450rpm, while 300rpm on 3.25” wheels gives a truespeed of around 3050”/s. Adding in friction, running 240 on 4” wheels or 300rpm on 3.25” wheels is our only option. 4” wheels have a rubber with more traction than 3.25” wheels, so we’ll likely be using those. We do also need to consider 5:3 highspeed on 3.25” (around 2700”/s), this has less friction but is slower. Our rebuild will likely also feature a gearbox, so 300rpm on 4” wheels might even be feasible if we build it right. This is all going to depend on how we decide to build the robot.</p>
