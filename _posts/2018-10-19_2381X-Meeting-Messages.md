# Intake
The first thing that we did this meeting was work on our intake. We started with just a scoop.
We realized that just the scoop, would not be able to pick up the balls. We then decided that we would put on a lower stanced intake with friction mat leading all the way up would be the best. The intake is two stage, there’s one 18T sprocket system with rubber bands on every other sprocket tooth. The second stage is using a 12T sprocket system, and has a little more compression on the ball, which is going to be extremely helpful for our passive intake/indexing system. The first stage is mounted on pillow bearings supported by plates, and the top stage is supported by bars and bearings with shafts running through standoffs. This was the only way we could have everything fit properly and efficiently.

# Guide Wheels
The next thing that we did was build guide wheels. The point of these wheels are to help facilitate center parking, by allowing sortof an inclined attack (so the front wheels are able to hit at an angle, and aren’t forced backwards. This would allow for faster parking. We experimented with a lot of different sprocket and gear sizes off-robot, and determined that a large 84t low-strength gear with zipties holding on rubber bands would be the best in terms of having the ability to help the robot climb, and also minimizing on the space requirements (the extrusions could be shaved down).

# Flywheel
It was determined that having a flywheel ratio of 1:15 would be better for flywheel spin-up times. Our previous flywheel ran 1:25 on two speed motors, and although it was able to keep rotational speed without burning out, it required a spin-up time of around 2 seconds. It also launched the ball with too much power, more than was necessary, especially with close-to-flag play that we generally expect. There was no use for having so much power, especially if it was causing our flywheel to have a long spinup and recovery time. With that in mind, we decided to switch to 1:15. This would give us options between 2400 rpm and 3600, compared to the 4000 rpm previously. Scaling between 2400 rpm and 3600 rpm allows us to quickly change out the internal motor gearings and decide and test. This will have to be done later. The flywheel itself was originally spaced quite wide, but in this iteration we wanted the shafts to be closer. That’s what we tried to do this time.
