<p>There have been quite a few improvement since last time, i’ll start with the most obvious changes, and then go into some smaller things. The first area of improvement is our flywheel gearing. This went through multiple concept and prototype stages before it was completed. The entire time we did keep the same ratio, but the way the gears were stacked, and the way that the floating tower was braced. Eventually, we ended up with the gearing that you can see in IMG_1628. The final 12T gear is mounted below the 36T gear, and the upper 12T gear is mounted above - this means that we are able to make everything a lot more compact, and drop the flywheel height some more. The first few iterations, we wanted to mount the final 12T above - this would give us more space for a stronger shaft collar, however we eventually reached the conclusion that a regular shaft collar would suffice, and the drop in height would be a greater advantage in terms of clearances for the rest of the robot. We have to use black spacers on the upper 60 T gear in order for it to clear the 12T gear (OD clearances), however this isn’t much of an issue as the new LS gears tend to stay put. In IMG_1631 you can see how close the final 36 and 12T gears are, in fact the 12T gear is sunken into the c-chnnel so that we have more space in the back. This is currently a metal pinion, a HS variant, however it will soon be swapped out for a LS gear - this will help lower friction and since the force on this final gear should be small, even though it is cantilevered, it is close to the bearing and should be ok. The biggest concern is that one bering is holding uptwo shafts, however this should be ok if we are able to maintain good build quality. The floating towerss are supported using 4 hole c-channels, which are currently still moving around as we add in the rest of the robot. The next thing that we worked on were tracking wheels. The idea behind tracking wheels is that we will get an absolute position of our robot on field - this can be incredibly useful when we’re running long autonomous programs, and especially so if it becomes more complex - for example clearing a bunch of flags - something which requires precise positioning and tracking. IMG_1632 shows the very first prototype we made of the tracking wheels, in position. We need two tracking wheels per side, and then one in the middle perpendicular to the other two. As you can see here, the two wheels were originally mounted on c-channels coming down from themiddle of the robot. This was later changed to give us more space down the center for the perp wheel (perpendicular middle wheel), by using longer screws and screwing in from c-channels dropped from the frame. IMG_1643 shows how we used a 5 segment 1xL, bearing, screws, and spacers to create a much smaller setup. VEX bearings have an issue where the intenal bearing is not perfect, so cantilevering wheels like this is the best for us because we are able to reduce the friction on the encoder - no need to go through multiple bearings. This setup was mirrored on the other side, with one change - the encoder was kept in the same orientation so that the cables would come off the top. This means that we needed spacers off of the 1xL to keep everything at a distance that could be hung of a screw. A standoff was added off the end later so that the wheel would not go past the rotational stop, because if it did then we would be at risk coming off the platform (it might’ve over-rotated o something, causing forces going through the wrong angle and the wrong thing being the stop). IMG_1646 shows the current progress, with an incredibly tall perp wheel mounting. This works for now, so we’re going to keep it. Once I have time, we will move it lower so that there’s less risk of it breaking. The perp wheel is special, as it runs an extra bearing (this is important because this wheel is taking a lateral hit when climbing the platform), IMG_1647 shows an up-close look at the wheel. This has been made out of 3-wide c-channel, and allows us to add another bearing and an encoder onto both sides of a 2.75” omni. This was sorta mounted however it would fit, vis-a-vis a 2x2 c-channel. The lower this is, the better it will be (at the moment it hits the other encoders and does not have a fun time). The last thing that has changed so far is the intake path - yes, it has changed. Again. This time the intake is completed with motor mount, and all that is left is mounting an indexer and a proper hood. We used aluminum plates to help size the hood, and will cut a lexan out with the same sizing as soon as we figure it out. I’ll start with the changes we made to the intake. 1: we changed the banding on the main sprocket. In IMG_1647 you can see the edge of a sprocket. Here you can see how the banding wraps around a screw and then goes back over the teeth - this means that we are able to tie the rubber bands together in the center, as shown in IMG_1667. This allows there to be less overall tension on the rubber bands - we were experienceing issues with the full-width rubber bands snapping due to over-stretching. A well made knot in the middle of the intake also gives the caps a better “whacK” as there’s more weight and tension going around. We found it also made the actual intake better on our stepper bar because it gave the balls just a little bit more contact or something - but we don’t want to depend on that. The screws are normaly 0.5” screws, and at first I wasn’t sure if the screwhead would be able to keep the rubber band on, but after a few quick trials, it seems to work fine (no need to add a washer or anything!). IMG_1668 shows a front view of the intake, here you can see that we’ve moved the indexer forward, closer to the front side of the tower - this means we have a longer flywheel hood path, but it seems to be around the same angle as before, but makes feeding everything a lot easier. The top roller is an 18T, hopefully this will give us enough control over the ball motion - a large 24T doesn’t fit nicely, and an 18 is generally a perfect sie. At the moment, it is not centered, however it should be centered soon. Hopefully the centering doesn’t matter because we won’t have a hardware refererence tocenter to. Then, we worked on getting the entire intke chained together. The only sprockets that would fit on our shafts were 6t sprockets, which meant that those were put on. We wanted the intake motor as low and close to the front as we could (to help balance weight), so we mounted it on a standoffed c-channel in IMG_1692. This C-channel assemlby holds the pillow bearings for the 6t sprockets, a chain tensioner to keep the chain off our wheels, as well as a large 24T sprocket fed by a motor. This gives us a ratio of 1:4, so i can either run 400rpm, 640rpm, or 960rpm. In my opinion, 960 sounds the best because it gives us a very very VERY fast intake, and also stalls the motor out (ie the motor doesn’t haev enough torque to bring the ball up past the index), so that we don’t run the risk of accidentally shooting. Running 400rpm (the other tested rpm) has enough torque to push both balls up and over the index. 640 might be a good middle ground too, because 960 is very aggressive and can easily stall if we don’t know what we’re doing. The indexer is either going to run 1:1 turbo (240rpm), or 3:1 on an external ratio (300rpm or something slightly higher). This should allow us to intake a ball from the wall and be able to shoot as soon as we are in position. IMG_1700 shows a front view with the completed motor, you can see that the motor itself is very low and close to the rollers (the lower center of gravity, the better). IMG-1702 shows a close-up of the actual assembly. With our intkae, we also added in our flywheel hood. We have a unique way of mouting ur flyheel hood and tensioning it that gives us a lot o options for change and adjustment, especially for fine tuning. We have mounted the standoffs holding down the 2-wide of the flywheel hood on a C-channel which is then mounted to our main towers. This gives us multiple levels of adjustment that straight mounting would not give us. It would also give us a lot more strength. IMG_1696 shows the final mounting positions that we chose, we used the middle hole on the tower so that we would be able to mount a 0.5” spacer properly (this was not necessary, we could have used 0.5” standoffs or a shaved spacer), and then picked the lower hole to mount the flywheel hood. This is still currently tentative, as we are unsure as to the compression of the hood. Once LEXAN or a non-shattering plastic (mayhaps delrin), we will be able to drill some mounting holes in the plastic and do some firing tests. AT the moment, the metal hood is there only for visual sizing purposes. The hood distancse can alsobe adjusted by using spacers. An encoder was mounted on the other side, you can see in IMG_1697 how this has been mounted. Currently there is nothing holding the encoder down - I plan to secure it very very soon.</p>
