This is about 15 minutes into my CAD design work, and I (anthony) quickly realized that it would not be too difficult to do a DLD gearing (drive lift differential). Because we have so many 60T gears, it’s not hard for us to put one in wherever we wanted, and using 8 motors along the base of our robot is a little bit excessive, and makes spacing on the intake very difficult. Using such a transmission, we are able to power a lift (I’ll explain how we can do this with such little range of motion later), and we are also able to save space on the intake.
CTP_006, CPT_007
Here, you can see that we are still trying to keep our robot within 20holes wide. Putting everything clase also reduces slop, because the shaft is able to bend less - the less bending a shaft does, the better it is for us. Here’s how a DLD works. 
This is why the final stage gearing is necessary. In the CAD as of right now, the last C-channel hits the final 60T gear, but this can easily be fixed by using either halfcut C-channels or by moving the C-channel up. In this instance I think that using halfcut C-channels might be the better option - the lift won’t have that much weight. Before I do that, I should probably complete the other side.
CPT_008
Here are both sides completed. You’ll notice that on the left side I did the CAD using halfcut pieces, and that there’s a second halfcut channel on the end, a few holes in. The spacing on these are 7 holes for each arm (14 holes), and 6 for the vertical piece, which means that the entire assembly is 20 holes and can be cut from a full section nicely. We were considering using 3 wide for the lift, so that we wouldn’t have to shave bearings, but after consultation we decided to save the weight and go with 2-wide. Apparently it will matter, according to PiLons lead builder Qaiz. We still haven’t put in bearings, screws, or axles, and haven’t finished bracing on both sides. I’m going to do that next.
CPT_009
Anthony again - I’ve finally added the bearings into the CAD file - it took a little bit longer than I expected, but it’s done. I also changed the bracing on the edges of the c-channels to use 3 hole c-channels, 4 in total for each side which means 12 holes, and then we have 2 4 hole braces across the top for both c-channels, which means that that can again be cut from a 20 section c-channel completely. 
At this point, the length of the arms is 7 holes, and the length of the vertical braces are 6 holes. (20). The issue however, is that if the vertical brace needed to complete the 4-bar is only 6 holes long, it will be difficult to drive the actual 4-bar from the mini 4-bar. But, how does the motion [a]
