So I spent a little bit of time dismantling the older drive, and spent some time working on the new drive base. We want to use two seperate c-channels going across the front and back of the drive base, this will give us a lot more flexibility in terms of mounting everything. We can run a whole setup of gears at the back, with a full suite of proper gearing, and then chain it up to the front. We started by looking at other drive bases of a similar style, and asking around to see what we should be looking out for. Here were a few problems that we’d identified (that are common).
# Low-Strength Axles (or regular axles)
There are low-strength axle issues, a lot. A large amount of torque going through gears will cause the axle to deflect and bend. Low strength axles will also wear out if metal rubs against them (for example, lock bars). 
# Low-Strength Gears
Low strength gears have an issue where they will flex and bend - this can cause them to interfere with other parts, or become misaligned and introduce friction. Low strength gears are also plastic, and the inserts can totally round out, and if we’re using that to transfer power into shafts we can very quickly stop sending power.
# Wheel inserts
Wheel inserts suffer from the same issues as the low strength gears, and if wheels round out - we’re done.
# Friction
Friction is a big killer - we want to make sure that there’s a little bit of play between the sides of non-moving bearings and the moving wheel assembly, about 1 teflon washer, and we want teflon between all moving parts.
Today also included a little bit of prototyping on the drive, that included setting up the “pilons drive”, which meant bolting together gears sprockets and the wheel.

Here you can see how everything is bolted together. There is a High Strength gear on the outside (so that power can be transferred through the gear into bolts as well as shafts), an 18T sprocket (this should allow clearances with C-channels without needing excessive tensioning, and then the wheel. The entire assembly fits into 7-hole spacing as you can see on the left.

Now, in order to make everything fit, we had to reduce the amount of “spacers” we used, thus the wheel is seperated from the bearing by a space of 2 teflon washers (this is necessary because otherwise indentations in the plastic wheel housing catch on the bearing”, and that goes straight into a shaft collar (still necessary, for some reason), and then into sprocket and geared with just enough spacing to comfortably clear. 
As I stated above, Shafts (especially low-strength ones), often have inserts rounded out. To solve this issue, we sent bolts all the way through - this way, we can transfer power through the bolts instead of the shaft - much nicer.

This bolt has not yet been zip-tied to the spoke, but once it is zip-tied down, it shouldn’t be moving much. These are precautionary bolts, but nonetheless are reassuring to have.

I also experimented with a few different methods of box-bracing today. Previously we have done screws with nuts, as shown in image 003. Today, I tried to do something like image 004. This is a lot simpler to maintain (ie if it needs to change spots), but I find that it does not “brace” as well as the screw through method.
