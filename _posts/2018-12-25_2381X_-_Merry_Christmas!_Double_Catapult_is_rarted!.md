So, anthony here. I rewatched some match footage and realized that doing a double catapult is totally ridiculous. You have 1 point to defend against. Flywheel is so much better in terms of autonomous. With that said, the entire robot spacing has to change because the way flywheel works is totally different from the way catapult spacing works. Our setup is going to look as follows:
* 6 drive
* 2 flywheel
* 1 intake 
* 1 index (linked to ball collector).
* 1 lift
* 1 cap-flipper
6 turbo motors won’t give us the pushing torque that we necessarily want, but if we’re able to control our motors, should allow us to get a pretty good amount of pushing done if we know how to transfer weight. The most important thing with 6 motor drive is still going to be weight distribution (we HAVE to be light), as well as linking the motors together - if we don’t link the motors, we’re in for some BIG trouble.
So, most of this is similar to the previous robot, just re-done for some better weight distribution. Our ball collector is something that can come down in front of our robot, and grab balls off of the platform or off of the caps, which should allow for an extremely full-fledged autonomous program (we can get 5 shots off JUST FROM THE FRONT), and then with a flywheel it doesn’t matter necessarily where we’re shooting from.What we noticed with a flywheel is that it has a very high consecutive shot speed (look at first robotics 2017), and we anticipate that robots are going to be making a lot of consecutive shots in game - this is where catapult speed falls behind. 
The reason we want a ball collector is so that we can get additional balls in autonomous, this is very important as it could technically allow us to clear the entire front row of flags if we play our cards right and are able to accurately track the position of our robot. The lift and cap flipper I think are going to be important, however they may be taken off in lieu of more drive motors (should we find ourselves needing that by the competition date).
As always, our robot will have wedges which are designed to take weight off the other robot and make it harder for them to get away. The rest of the robot will be explained as the build occurs.
