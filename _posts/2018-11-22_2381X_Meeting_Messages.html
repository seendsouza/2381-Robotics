<p>This wasn’t really a meeting, just a run through and packing of all our stuff before the competition. We decided that it would be a good idea to take some old t-shirts and “pad” the sides of the box with the t-shirts. This should protect the robot a bit more, and we would also be able to prevent parts from moving in ways that theyshouldn’t and then breaking. The t-shirts also act as a cover, and help to prevent people from getting caught on the robot, or even just as a cover to keep the robot warm (going between 25 degree gyms and -15 outside is not good). We would have used packing peanuts, but realized that…it wasn’t a good idea. We also realized that despite our robot not being able to climb before, there is now a way for us to be able to climb with our robot. If we get a cap up in front of our robot, we’re able to run that against a platfrom and then park. This takes a little bit longer, but is definitely a viable workaround to the robot. We also learend that keps nuts do NOT like to stay tight if there’s intense vibration. On the drive train, and other towres. Keps are perfectly fine, however, on our flywheel hood the keps nuts loosened every time, and we couldnt tighten down enough for us to prevent them from falling off. Our fingers weren’t small enough to put them back on, so we just took bars and braced them that way. Hopefully our entire setup remains stable enough. We are also experiencing a lot of random disconnects from vexnet, not sure why that is. While three of our four members are competing, one is going to be staying in ottawa working on the cad and design of our second robot. During this competition, we’ll see how the robot does and we’ll be able to come back to school on monday with a plan for the next rebuild. We plan to stay 20 wide, but maybe we can spare a few motors for other things.</p>
