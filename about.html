<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>2381 Robotics is a club run in Colonel By Secondary School in Ottawa. We currently have three competitive teams, 2381C, 2381X, and 2381Y, which meet several times a week in order to work on their robot for VEX Robotics Competitions. Our competitive teams are full of dedicated individuals who have been frequently travelling around Ontario to compete against other teams. We will soon offer casual teams, which have fewer meetings and tournaments, and are meant for beginners, or those who are more interested in learning and trying new things as opposed to competing in tournaments. We have a very diverse set of bright students coming from all over the city due to the prestigious International Baccalaureate (IB) program offered at our school.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Our club has been around for a very long time, however, we only started competing in VEX competitions since the 2017-18 season. Our executive team has been working tirelessly in order to organize all the events and incorporate the VEX experience into the club. It currently is the main focus of the club’s activities.</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Our club has had a history of performing well in competitions, and we have the awards to prove it. Last year, our club’s 2381C team won the Innovate Award for creating a unique design and innovative program. This year, our 2381X team won the Build Award, Tournament Champions and the Think Award. With half a year left, our three competitive teams will compete for many more.</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<p>At Colonel By Robotics, we believe in hard work, passion, and most important of all, having fun. Our school provides a dedicated workspace for us to practice and prepare for competitions. With experienced members and all the necessary resources, all our members are afforded the opportunity to test, build, and program their robots. We encourage all members to do research outside of school and communicate effectively with all their team members in order to get the most out of their experiences.</p>
