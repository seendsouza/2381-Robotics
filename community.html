<h2>Henry Munro Robotics Demos</h2>
<p>To children wanting to come to our school from middle school in Henry Munro, we showed the current states of our VEX robot and explained to them the design concepts behind it. This was done in order to spark an interest in robotics and engineering within the young and fresh minds of said individuals.</p>
<h2>FLL Robotics Mentor</h2>
<p>Victor, the primary builder and designer for 2381C, coaches and mentors an FLL team, and uses his previous knowledge from FLL and his current knowledge to guide the students towards success.</p>
<h2>VEX Forum</h2>
<p>Anthony, the head of 2381X, has released CAD reveals and is an active member of the VEX forum. He helps new teams by giving them a strong starting point and helping those who have questions. Check him out @ranoom.</p>
<h2>Code Reveals</h2>
<p>Both 2381C and 2381X have released code reveals in order to help other teams get a feeling for what their code should look like if they are inexperienced. Sean, the lead programmer from 2381C, made templates for new V5 teams where they just need to change port numbers in the code in order to have all their motors work and with multiple drives already programmed in. At the bottom of the page, there are GitLab and GitHub pages with the code reveals and template.</p>
